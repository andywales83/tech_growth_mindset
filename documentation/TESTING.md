#### *New Visitor*
1. As a first time visitor, I want the main purpose of the site to be immediately clear.
2. As a first time visitor, I want the look of the site to be visually appealing.
3. As a first time visitor, I want the layout of the site to be well structured and easy to navigate.
4. As a first time visitor, I want to have an idea of the content that the site offers, before deciding to register.
5. As a frist time visitor, I want to be able to easily find and use the registration page, if I choose to register.
6. As a first time visitor, I want to see ways of communicating with the site's creators, via social media or a contact page.

- The Home Page has been designed to be simplistic, yet fully evidence what the site is about. In addition to this, the purpose of the site is also mentioned in the Footer. The colour palette used, was chosen to keep the site as visually appealing as possible. The home page is essentially split in to two sections, the first being the main title and image for the site with a call to action button, the second being a section that hosts the weekly featured content, controlled by the sites admin. This gives a visitor an idea of what content the site holds. The Footer hosts a contact us section where users can reach out to the sites creator. Non-registered users will also have access to the registration page through a link in the navbar.
